## 👋 Hey, I'm Noah

I'm a Software Development student at Grand Canyon University interested in a wide range of computer-related things.
I'm a chronic project starter, but a not-so-consistent project finisher, a sucker for force-directed graphs, and a fan of websites that involves blocky, retro-looking design- not a big
fan of the sleek and modern feeling ones. 

⚙️ I'm currently working on a decent personal website.. *it's almost easier to code one than it is to think up how I want it to look*
